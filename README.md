# **Advantages of Having a Brain**

## **Project Description**
This repository contains the code developed for the project titled *Advantages of Having a Brain*, a dissertation presented for the degree of MSc in Computational Applied Mathematics at the University of Edinburgh. The project explores the evolution of intelligence using a mathematical model based on the work of [McNally et al. (2012)](http://doi.org/10.1098/rspb.2012.0206). The model simulates populations of individuals represented by artificial neural networks, engaging in various game theory scenarios. These interactions aim to study the selective pressures that drive the development of advanced cognitive abilities in different social environments.

Supervisors: Dr. Tibor Antal and Mr. Alex Richardson

## **How to Install and Run the Project**
1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/arturmiralles/Advantages-of-Having-a-Brain.git
   ```
2. **Navigate to the project directory:**
   ```bash
   cd Advantages-of-Having-a-Brain
   ```
3. **Run the Simulation:**
   - Open `Simulation.py`.
   - Choose your desired parameters (e.g., population size, number of generations, mutation probabilities) and specify the name of the output CSV file.
   - Execute the code:
     ```bash
     python Simulation.py
     ```
   - The results will be saved as a CSV file in the specified directory.
